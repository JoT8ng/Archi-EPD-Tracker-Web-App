                <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
                <p className='terms-text'>
                    <span style={{ fontWeight: '700' }}>In Short:</span> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol &#40;IP&#41; address and/or browser and device 
                    characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.

                <p className='terms-text'>
                    We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. 
                    This information does not reveal your specific identity &#40;like your name or contact information&#41; 
                    but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device

                <h3>Our Use of Cookies</h3>
                <p className='terms-text'>
                    A cookie is a file containing an identifier &#40;a string of letters and numbers&#41; that is sent 
                    by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back 
                    to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may be either 
                    "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser 
                    and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry 
                    date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when 
                    the web browser is closed.
                </p>
                <p className='terms-text'>
                    Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, 
                    but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information 
                    stored in and obtained from cookies.
                </p>
                <p className='terms-text'>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
                <p className='terms-text'>&#40;a&#41; We use session cookies to identify users and track their activity when they use the Service.</p>
                <h2 className='terms-title2'>2. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

                <h2 className='terms-title2'>3. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
                <p className='terms-text'>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a 
                    Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to 
                    have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform 
                    technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do 
                    not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates 
                    your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must 
                    follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
                </p>

                <p className='terms-text'>
                    We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated 
                    by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. 
                    If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a 
                    notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this 
                    privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
